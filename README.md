# Flask-Site
A simple GUI using Flask and Python for the backend application. Frontend is vanilla JS, CSS and HTML. The backend database is PostgreSQL. 

The following app was implemented to demonstrate my knowledge of Python, Flask framework and PostgreSQL. Moreover, there was no frontend libraries and the frontend is not optimized for prettiness at this time.
